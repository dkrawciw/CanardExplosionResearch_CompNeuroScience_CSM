## Project Info

## Our Goals
We are researching Canard Explosions in our Computational Neuroscience class. This Repository contains tests and functions for our results.

1. Have functions/files together to compute solutions to 2D Reduced HH and FH-N models that include the applied current specified in BÃ¶rgers

2. Work to find parameter range to make Canard Explosions

3. Obtain information on dynamics when the Neuron exhibits Canard behavior

4. Make animations for them displaying this behavior

5. Move on to work with systems of neurons exhibiting canard explosions

6. Compare original reduced HH/FH-N model parameters to system parameters
